# NASA - Detect Track and Remediate: The Challenge of Small Space Debris

## Description of the Concept

This paper aims to provide a suitable solution for the "Challenge of small space debris" proposed by NASA. More specifically, we will tackle the debris remediation domain.
To this end, we will assume that the position and trajectory for each disposable piece of debris is precisely known. Furthermore, we will consider any form of detection or tracking of debris out of the scope of this paper.

### Background

Every year, hundreds of orbital launches take place in the Earth, each of these carrying between one and over a hundred space satellites.\cite{Krebs2023}. Every time a piece of debris (or any untracked rock or space object) hits a satellite, it creates more debris and, as a consequence, the degradation of said satellite. This newly created debris will also participate in the process of producing more debris, on an exponential rate. This effect is known as "The Kessler Syndrome"\cite{Kessler2010}\cite{Drmola2018} and currently, fragmentation debris (1–10 cm) are considered the main threat in LEO, (Low Earth Orbit), compared to the far less numerous large objects, such as derelict rockets\cite{Maier2013}.
Thus, it is coherent to affirm that the more satellites orbiting the Earth, the more space debris is indirectly created. 

### Solution Description

Our proposed solution consists on using a swarm of small satellites, in which each member is equipped with a solar-pumped laser (Figure 1). For the purpose of simplicity, we will refer to these devices as "cleaning satellites".
Each one of these cleaning satellites would direct a laser beam directly to our target piece of debris and, using laser ablation, we would slow it down and lower its height enough for it to be absorbed into the atmosphere.
